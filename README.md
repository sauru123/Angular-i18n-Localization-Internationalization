Localization In Angular Using i18n Tools
In this article, we will learn how to make our Angular app offered in different languages using i18n and localization. We will generate an Angular application and configure it to serve the content in three different languages. We will also organize our app to Localhost://4200 which is offered by default by the Angular server and see how localization works in real time.
We will use Angular 8.0.2 and VS Code to develop our application. Take a look at the application output.
